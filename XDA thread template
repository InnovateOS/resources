[SIZE="4"]InnovateOS is a project based on CM (CyanogenMod). We started this project for Learning more on Android, to make a stable CM based Rom, which would include OMS and some important customization. The Rom is kept minimal to deliver awesome smoothness and includes a custom kernel. This is the Initial Release and slowly we will add some more features in coming builds. [/SIZE]
